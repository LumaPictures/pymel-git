class ObjectNamer(object):
    """
    Utility object to remap object names onto something appropriate.
    The simplest mapping is to return the name itself. If that's all
    you are ever going to do then don't use this class.
    
    The main use for this class is to anonymize names that might be
    considered sensitive. The anonymizing mode will ensure that the
    real name always matches the same generated name, and will give
    some minimal information within the name itself. (e.g. a file
    name will be called file_001, a directory name might be called
    dir_031, and a Maya transform node could be called transform_042.
    
    If you know how many objects you will be naming you can call
    ObjectNamer.setMaxObjects(). This will guarantee that the formatting
    of the anonymized names can be lexically sorted correctly by using
    a zero-padded integer numbering system. This is useful because
    "file02" comes before "file10" but "file2" comes after it.
    
    The following anonymizer modes are supported:
    
            ObjectNamer( ObjectNamer.MODE_NAME )
                    Names have no specific type. The are anonymized generically
                            MySecretObject -> name01
            ObjectNamer( ObjectNamer.MODE_PLUG )
                    Names are assumed to be Maya plug names. The node name part is
                    anonymized but the attribute name is left as-is.
                            MySecretNode.translateX -> node001.translateX
            ObjectNamer( ObjectNamer.MODE_NODE )
                    Names are assumed to be Maya node names. The node name part is
                    anonymized using the node type as a root if this module is
                    executed inside of Maya, otherwise the generic 'node' is used.
                            In Maya:        MySecretTransform -> transform001
                            Standalone: MySecretTransform -> node001
            ObjectNamer( ObjectNamer.MODE_PATH )
                    Names are assumed to be file paths. The first sections of the path
                    are anonymized as directories, the final one is anonymized as a
                    file. Paths with trailing separators (e.g. "/") are assumed to be
                    directories. Paths are made into canonical form so all backslashes
                    are replaced by forward slashes on Windows.
                            root/parent/child/MySecretFile.ma -> dir1/dir2/dir3/file1.ma
                            root/parent/child/MySecretDir/  -> dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4/
